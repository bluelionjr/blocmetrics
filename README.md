Blocmetrics

Blocmetrics is an analytics service to track events on websites with a few key features:

1. A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events on their website.

2. A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a database.

3. A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a user.
